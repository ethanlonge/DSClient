# DSClient

## Note for running tests
If you are running tests, make sure to specify the entrypoint class as `comp3100.dsclient.Main.class`
This will allow it to run as `java comp3100.dsclient.Main.class`

## Note for running stage2
First compile the source code, then copy the comp3100 folder from the output to the stage2-test folder.

Then run `./stage2-test-x86 -o tt -n "java comp3100.dsclient.Main"` from the stage2-test folder
